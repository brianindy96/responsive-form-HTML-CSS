# responsive-form-HTML-CSS

Description: After finishing topics on Form Basics and Validations with HTML on Odin-Project, decided to put in Theory into Practice with this small project.

Reflections:

1. The form is responsive to a certain point. 

2. Should be able to create forms for default websites that ask for email, passwords, and to accept conditions. 

3. Learned the difference between "GET" and "POST"
